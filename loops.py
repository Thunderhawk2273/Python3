#A loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, tuple, set, dictionary, or a string)


people = ['Paul','John','Trinidad','Trobago','Hobbes', 'Calvin', 'George']

#Simple loop
#for person in people:
#    print(f'Current person: {person}')

#Break
#for person in people:
#    if person == 'Hobbes':
#        break
#    print(f'Current person: {person}')

#Continue
#for person in people:
#    if person == 'John':
#        continue
#    print(f'Current person: {person}')

#for i in range(len(people)):
#    print(people[i])

#for i in range(0,11):
#    print(f'Number: {i}')


#While loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true

#count = 0
#while count < 10:
#    print(f'Count: {count}')
#    count += 1
